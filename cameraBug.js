This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera controls.  The issue is that when the user interacts with these custom controls (e.g., pressing a button to toggle flash or change camera type), the camera preview freezes or becomes unresponsive. The preview might briefly show a black screen or a distorted image before eventually restoring, but this interruption disrupts user experience.  The problem doesn't appear consistently, it's intermittent.  Standard Expo Camera functionality works fine; the problem only surfaces with custom controls added.
